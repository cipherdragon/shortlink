# ShortLink

A URL-shortening service which can integrate seemlessly with your existing PHP
webiste.

## Problem context

This software is made to solve a problem I faced. Writing this section because
you will understand what this software is about and why it was made.

I'm a webadmin maintaining a wordpress website for a non-profit. Wordpress has a
redirection plugin but not very friendly for non-technical users. I wrote this
software to allow our editors to create shortened URLs without them asking me to
do it. Because the website is wordpress, this software is written in a way to
integrate with PHP websites.

As the admin, create a account, i.e, username and password for your editor(s).
They can then login and create shortened URLs. 

## Development notice

This software is in development. It is not ready for production use. Does not
currently even have an admin panel to create accounts. If you dare, send
requests to the API using curl or some other tool.

Installation guide and a usage manual will be provided once the software is
ready for production use.

This README is written now rather than once production release is ready just
for the sake of completeness.
